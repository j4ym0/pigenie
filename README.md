This is a starting point for me to use energy smarter. Using energy generated in a smarter and more efficient way.

## Goals
  -  Automaticity turn power on and off when generating enough
  -  View historical usage / generation


## Why use it
  -  If you have Solar PV, Wind or other generation. You could use this to setup a smarter home.
  -  Match your generation to you usage. If you want to put the dryer on, set it to start when there is enough electricity generated to power it for free.
    
    
## Do's and Don'ts
  -  I don't suggest connect your fridge, TV, Lights or any appliance that will require energy to function when there is nothing been generated.
  -  Do not try and control any emergency system.
  
  -  Control your washer, dryer and immersion heater
  -  Control a portable heater


## Todo's
  - multiple monitors for supply & genaration
  - check usage is not outstriping supply for whole hosue and adjust
